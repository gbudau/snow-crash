We scan the virtual machine and find a file owned by the flag00 user:

level00@SnowCrash:~$ find / -user flag00  2> /dev/null
/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

The file contains something which seems to be an encrypted passphrase:

level00@SnowCrash:~$ cat /usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

After some investigation we realize it's a simple enconding, using affine cypher. We decode it using https://www.dcode.fr/affine-cipher:

A=1,B=15	nottoohardhere

We log with that password into flag00 and run getflag:

level00@SnowCrash:~$ su flag00
Password:
Don't forget to launch getflag !
flag00@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
