We disassemble the level07 binary and notice it's reading the LOGNAME environment variable
then constructs a string using asprinf with the following format: "/usr/bin/echo %s" where the formated string parameter
is the value of LOGNAME

We execute the binary with the following payload and get the flag:

LOGNAME='&& getflag' ./level07
