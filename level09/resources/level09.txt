We run the binary with some inputs and notice the input is encoded by adding the index to each ascii character

We create a python script to decode the token file, get the token and use it as password for the flag10 user
then we get the flag

def decode_bytes(filename):
    """Decode a file where each byte has been encoded by adding its index."""
    with open(filename, "rb") as f:
        encoded_bytes = f.read().strip()

    decoded_bytes = bytearray()
    for index, byte in enumerate(encoded_bytes):
        decoded_byte = (byte - index) % 256
        decoded_bytes.append(decoded_byte)
    return decoded_bytes

if __name__ == "__main__":
    token_filename = "token"
    decoded_output = decode_bytes(token_filename)

    print("Decoded content:")
    print(decoded_output.decode())
